ex, I don't think so...~
  Well, the other day I was going along Highstaff killing things
and I got the I don't think so... message (you know the one you
gods give me when I've been naughty with my charm monster spell)
<grin> But of course, I wasn't doing anything particually wrong
at that time. Some god (no identification( told me to keep an eye
out for it and let em know if it happens again it did only not
the same circumstances and I couldn't reproduce it  <shrug>
  Oh, bye the way I love this board, helps make highstaff more of
a community type place like shylar, only for higher levels, but
is there anyplace to BUY water??

right.  Okay, when you go 1 or 2 north from the outside of the
golden dragon then go east once you are put to the small area
behind the golden dragon.  the one you need to go east from
inside the dragon to get to.

That is no bug.  Do to our current exits available, there was no

they do.

Lost Equipment~
Cyric,
I was playing last night (Wed. the 27th) and the game crashed.
When I logged on today (28th) I found that I had lost all of my
equipment.  I was wondering if a reimbursement would be possible.
It sounded like quite a few other people had lost their equipment
too.

stats~
My stats (str, dex, etc) really kinda suck. This is NOT just
another whiney note. I was thinking thaat perhaps one could use
practices to increase one's stats. This is not entirely without
basis.  One could prctice "wieghtlifting" or some equivalent
skill to increase strength instesd of practicing the latest
fighting techniques.  One could read and study to increase
knowledge(Wisdom), or practice juggling to increase dexterity.
Skills like this would allow those of us born with low stats a
chance to improve them without handing out stat increases
indescriminately, or upsetting the "game balance" by having loads
of characters running around with perfect stats, or if they did
they would hav no spells or other skills and so balance out the
character that way.
Just my 2 cents.

I agree with ender -- There are ways for a person to increase his
strength, dexterity but maybe not so much constitution and
intelligence.  If widsom is common sense then there are certain
things that could be done to raise that also.

Stats~
There are already objects in the game that allow you to raise
your stats.  I think what you guys are looking for are new stats
altogether.  I have a suggestion.  I've noticed that on several
other muds that once a char- acter reaches a certain level
(usually 5th) they have a place they can go to redistribute or
reroll their statistics.  The Forgotten Realms mud eastablishes
base stats (8 for all) and allows you to add extra points from a
pool on to any stat you wish.  I think they limit the change to
only once or twice per character.  I realize that this would take
a while to implement, but I thought I'd throw the idea out for
discussion.

An Important Suggestion~
Swift, the amazing first level thief here!

     I would like to make a suggestion...  I thinks that it would
be great if someone could install an autosave function, so that
whenever anyone dies, they are automatically saved...  I have
personally lost all my equipment six times, and I believe that
this detracts a bit from the gaming atmosphere.  Would an
autosave help this?  I've played on other MUDs with such a
feature, and it worked quite well.

                                     Just my thoughts,
                                     Swift, the thief

quests~
Hiya! not to try to sound pushy ar what not but i spend most of
of my time in hi ghstaff now and ive noticed that the last 4
quests have all been based around shylar, not to sound greedy or
anything cause i did get the halberd from the goblins and the
gold from grugnik but how about some highstaff based quests?
theres not a lot to attract people here and u think baseing some
quests here might increase the population more

say just an idea - - Kim the princess of wisdom

Stats II~
Well,  yes i  kinda want  new  stats, and   i  like  the  idea
of   being able   to reroll,  but I   am  willing to spend
practice  sessinonsto  iimprove stats,  or   most  any  other
cost/quest/effort  the  gods  see   fit.  I agree that   there
are  objects to  raiise   stats,   but  when  stats  suck  as
badly as mine  (5 con,  8  str  9  wis  11 dex  and  14  wis)
the  objects (except  for  tiera)  don't   really help  worth
mentionioning.  (sorry for   the extra  spacing,  but  ths

stats III~
well Ender if you will recall in D&D there is such a thing as Max
level which is based on races and according to abilities, i dont
think the code here has been written for that but maybee it just
fal into place that the higher you get with such low stats the
less you actually increase power. my suggestion would be retire
and start again, looking at your stats i would guarantee better
rolls, and you will have equpment to 'hand down' to your new guy
to make low levels easier to obtain and in no time youll be back
where you are and better than before

Two things:
1) I love what you are doing with the areas.....Highstaff is now
   a better place to live, Midgaard is more exciting, and the Orc
   caves Are tough..  Great diversity....

2) The guards in midgaard seem to have a problem?  After i kill
   the one at the gate, the square and the one at the temple, they
   regenerate at the alter....????  Why is that?  5 guards at once
   is even a challenge to Corwin, let alone me??

Some thoughts~
Scrolls --
  They are much better now that they have titles on them.  Could
those of us with spell craft, or who already know the spell on
the scroll understand those cryptic titles?

Strength spell --
  Why can't fighter mages or even mages alone get 18 with bonuses
from the strength spell?  I have an 18 strength without the spell
and there are still some weapons, a heavy hammer for example,
that I am unable to wield.  Does the spell help fighters with an
18 (50) strength?

Blacksmith...~
There seems to be a problem with the blacksmith.  Whenever He
fixes armor, he decreases the value by one.  On apraise it says:
   effective : [4]
   when repaired: [5]

But when i get it repaired, It goes down to [4]. Why is this?...

And if it supposed to be like this, why did you take away our
supply to Isha's armor?  Now it will never be the same........

- it was allready explained to us why isha has no more dragon
  scale
- there is more dragon scale in the game we havenet found it (so
  i was told)

- can we get our prac lists during sleep? woul dbe a major help
- muth the orc guards are stil in the same place, and warriors
  still all regen in same room

RE: levels~
Yup.  Sorry about that, but you must admit the old exp tables
were horribly unfair.  Once you hit level 20+ it became trivial
to go up in levels, which tells ME that either it shouldn't be so
easy, or we should go back to only having 20 levels.  IE:  If the
levels aren't hard to get, they don't mean much... and if they
don't mean much, why bother?

So, I apologize to the few high level people who will feel hurt
by this, but look at it this way... as long as you don't get
level drained, you're WAY ahead of everyone else!

Hmmm... I agree with the new level tables... they are far more
right than they were.  Except that between 14th-20th theres not
many good places to get experience on your own.  (God only knows
how mnay times I leveled the stands).

But really, these levels are pretty worthless for me.  I haven't
gained a new spell or skill since 16th, and I'm 22nd now!  Its 
getting dull.

and the undead thing is okay, but it kinda sucks... burying every
corpse is time-consuming...  but thats a god's decision...

anyhow... add new ranger spells.

I don't like starting over when I die.
See, I died and suddenly needed like 4.2 million to advance.
Now, I am  31st level, so it's coming back, but I'm also 
logged in for like 30 hours a week.  and 30 hours is a lot 
to advance.

Rules of the game~
Hello, players.

It has always been the policy of WileyMUD in the past to allow
only one playing character per person.  The rule is somewhat
relaxed, but the Gods consider the simultaneous use of characters
by one person to be EVIL.  Such players are warned against using
two characters, lest the wrath of the gods might be visited upon
the offenders.

If you have any questions, please post them to this board and I
will attempt to clarify the policy.

Thanks

Appraising~
What I see when I appraise an item is the statements:
It is very well balance.
and
It has definite magical properties.
Granted, it doesn't give hit/dam scores or such, but is a good
indicator of the damage level of the weapon and it's current
condition.  I will look into this further to see if I can improve
it.

ACandSuch~
ok, so im lucky enough to have my ac at 0 with eq and no spells,
dont call me greedy but when i equip my shield that is 15ac i
would think that my ac would drop to -1 at least. Am i wrong? or
is there a limit to AC that can be gained by eq?

Also, in an effort to try different things, i am lowering my
align to try different eq and cant see to lower my alignment
anymore.  I was told that bury makes you better so i stopped
burying and tried to get and junk them or give them to hermit.
This isnt working.  I am killing good citizens of
highstaff,doves,young lasses, its not working.  Perhaps something
is wrong with this Pfile, i dont know.

Stop your pouting, edge.  Go to shylar, slay all the villagers

Go after the pegasuses in the mountains.  Avoid killing thieves,
gypsies, seedy boys, gamesman, drenth, slaadi, mountain giants,
etc.

Don't bury anything, and don't kill the undead that come from
that, if possible.

Hopefully there will be a nice area for you to become evil in
soon.  Its much easier to make experience being good.

I got a question about the poison spell, cause i tried to cast it

tried to detect poison on it and also on myself and non of those
told me if the object was actually poisoned.  Shouldnt detect
poison and the poison work on objects in the way that i used em?
could some one look at it? and is the poison permanent on
objects? or what?

RE: unfair~
The only reason it's unfair is that nobody is playing.  The
features I've added to make the game more challenging assume a
smalish-normal playerbase of about 10-20 people online at any
given moment.  As you see, with only 1 or 2, it becomes MUCH
harder.

Wiley has *ALWAYS* been designed around people grouping together
instead of wandering around solo... yes, you could do it solo...
but it was DAMN hard!

My suggestion would be to try and convince a few friends to give
the place a chance and join up with you.  I haven't gone out of
my way to advertise the place because, frankly, I don't think
it's out of beta-testing yet.  I think you'll find that if we get
someone dedicated to runing the place full-time (IE:  not a coder
like me... a real IMM with no other side-projects to distract
him/her), and a few dozen players, the game will be a hell of
alot of fun.

FYI:  My last goal in coding this thing is to finish divorcing
the data files from their hard-coded state so future imms can
expand this thing easily.  If I ever get the chance to finish
that, I'll be more than happy to look around for anyone wanting
to really run this game as a game instead of a test-bed.

It shall never be as it once was, but perhaps I can take a little
bit of it with me to another place.

Farewell.

At last!~
At last, you have come!  Long years have passed since anyone
has arrived from the hamlet of Shylar... we had believed the
mountains were closed.  But you are here!  There may be hope
for us yet!
