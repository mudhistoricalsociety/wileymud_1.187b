The Immortal Pantheon of WileyMUD Creators is split into three great segments.

     *** Respect and Admiration go the the Ancient Dead of WileyMUD II ***

--- Mad Cyric, the Destroyer.
    The implementor and head of the Old Gods.  Cyric brought forth the
    world from nothingness, and almost abolished it to nothingness again.
--- Muthaarin'akya, Essence of the World.
    God of the Map, it was He who created much of what remains.
--- Harlequin, God of the Mortal Realm.
    A God who walked the lands of Wiley, keeping order.
--- Grimwell, God of Mists and Deception.
    Devious in coding, random in nature.
--- Derkhil, Overlord of the West.
    He has taken control of much of Harlequin's western domain.
--- Elcid, Lord of the Heavens.
    One of the most ancient Gods.
--- Daisy, Mistress of the Link.
    A friend of all the Gods, it is She who binds the world in place.
--- Muidnar, the Dark Necromancer.
    Powerful and arrogant, He strives to improve the world through pain.

     *** Scorn and revile the demotion of these wretched idle spectres! ***

>>> Zar the (N)ever Present.
    Despite having the longest playing time on WileyMUD II, the Master of 43
    days seldom shows his face in the New World.
>>> Highlander the God of the Underdark.
    When the wine doth flow, so doth the generosity of Highlander... But if
    it be dry in the lands, wretched shall be the mortal who disturbs him!
>>> Malistrum the Shadowlord.
    Lest ye fail to notice the movement behind you, let me point to the
    Patron of the Fey.  A God of quick imagination and corrupt wit, Malistrum
    seeks to twist the world with magic of a dark and foreign source.
>>> Sedna the Lady of the Deep Realms.
    A goddess of quick temper, but generous heart.  Her recent coup attempt
    succeeded until she realized what she had gotten herself into and
    surrendered control back to the Dread Lord.
>>> Dirk the Daring.
    Seldom seen these days, this God once noted and fixed many of the
    little mistakes and oversights that plagued the world.  He now tries
    to follow his idol, Zar, into the oblivion of the idle.

          *** All MUST acknowledge the New Order of WileyMUD III ***

>>> Dread Quixadhal, Lord of VI.
    The driving force (whip?) behind everything you see, and much that
    you do not.  Quixadhal dragged the source of All back from the clutches
    of the Modem God, and has harnessed its powers anew.
>>> Vile Muidnar, the Dark One.
    The arrogant bastard whelp of WileyMUD II has returned, intent of
    bringing back the pain and suffering that the original game once
    had.  He corrupts with the blessings of Dread Quixadhal.
