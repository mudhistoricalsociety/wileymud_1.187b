WileyMUD III is the result of a good deal of tinkering by
many hands over the years.  It is now up to whomever can
read this to make it into something living once again.

You have a totally original world, a codebase that has
some very unique twists, and is fairly stable, an offline
world builder utility, and a conversion program in case
you decide to move to another driver.

Make it interesting, and leave us a footnote in history
somewhere.  Thanks!
