  -- Made a backup of all the world files and gzipped them. 

950624	Quixadhal
  0540	Nice log file!  I'll make a note to actually add things here :)
950625	Quixadhal
  0109	Changed protections of active world files to 440.  This means when
	you edit the file you have to use :w! to write it out (from vi).
	It adds an extra measure of "Doh!" protection.
  0345	Added Dirk's fixes to the worldfile.  These include numerous
	spelling corrections, and the correction of the odd exit mappings
	in the mansion and in the cemetary near shylar.
  0346	Applied my own diffs as well, to add in my immortal home.
	NOTE:  The order of the patches is important... You must apply
	Fred's patch first, then mine.  If you do it the other way, Fred's
	will fail.
  0410	Fixed a typo for #1018 (which was $1018)... oops!
  0426	Changed all reset times for zones... hopefully this will reduce
	the number that reset all at the same time.
	BTW:  This makes the 30-40minute slot pretty cramped!
  0532	Fixed a few bugs in the world file (damn diku... D4.. not D5!)
	renamed this file to HACKLOG to make it more evil.
950626	Quixadhal
  0320	Added Dirk's room.
950628  Muidnar
  2015  Went through by hand on the obj 1 - 5000 and changed prices and checked 
        objects...
950701	Quixadhal
  0337	Moved all backup files to a subdirectory.
950702	Quixadhal
  0600	Renamed zones to be more asthetic.
	Old names (with credits) are kept in ZONE.LIST.  Someday we can put
	this online somewhere... maybe.
950703	Quixadhal
  0600	Unlinked enterance to Serpent's Reach...
	Room 10079 should have a North link to 15047... it now points
	to 10079 until we get the zone finished or at least have a few
	mobs in it!
950709	Quixadhal
  0315	Created Xenthia, Lady of the Dead for the zombie master routine.
	She will be non-agressive near Shylar somewhere, and she will wander
	to find bodies.
950709	Quixadhal
  0900	Moved backup dir out of main lib area... makes for easier backups.
950710	Quixadhal
  0047	Added Kevin's non-theme immortal area.  Muidnar can beat the living
	crap out of him if he cares.... :)
	Added Xenthia's specials a bit better.
	Added a very annoying mosquito.
950729	Quixadhal
  0700	Added Druegar Berserker axe with special routine.... nasty!
950828	Quixadhal, of course
  0600	Finished running the world through ispell.  Also corrected it so
	that the world builder program will read it... we can now do offline
	building as if we were online... kindof....  not an lp, but it's a
	start.  Much better than vi anyways.
950830	Quixadhal
  0124	Added faerie village zone.... the rooms are being made.
950903	Quixadhal
  2253	Added an evil creature to the world... 3044... argh!
951004	Dirk
  0017	Fixed a few spelling mistakes in the mob file (Lovitar mobs)
951214	Quixadhal
  0508	Lots of changes happened during the coup... but almost none were
	logged so oh well.
	I have added Highlander's drow outpost, minus the two links to the
	outside world... we'll have to add those tomorrow/today.
	I also added the first few rooms of the faerie village... yes, you
	can accidentally teleport in there and never get back out... oops...
	oh well... hopefully I'll finish it before any newbies find it :)
951215	Quixadhal
  0420	Chanced world file to fix Kevin's exits.
	Also upped prices on gnarled branches.
951216	Quixadhal
  1300	Fixed the doors in Kevin's area.
951219	Quixadhal
  2134	Selected three hammers for the new earthquake spell.  Made sure they
	were holdable and wieldable.
951220	Quixadhal
  0534	Gave Grimdale the Axe... we'll see.....
951221	Quixadhal

	mob and some equipment.

        use to adding rooms again....

        sure all rooms where linked correctly by mapping it.
960418	Quixadhal

	world yet.
000527	Quixadhal
  1130	Deleted Morrighan's immortal area and cleaned up Eli, Tate and Karrn.
	We'll get this stuff up and running sans all the stupid immortals and
	Quixadhal's Bag 'O Mortal Tricks.
