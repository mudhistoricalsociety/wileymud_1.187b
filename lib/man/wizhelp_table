    Wizard chat.  Just like group chat, but all wizards see this.
#
ADVANCE
    Gives a player (or mob) levels as if they had earned them.
    A nice way to reward players who do something really cool.
    I think negative arguments will demote players as well!
#
AT
    Used to execute a command at the location specified.  Typically,
    this will be the name of a mob or player.

    "at eli trans bozo" -- teleports bozo to eli
#
DEBUG
    Adjusts the debug level.  Don't go above 2 unless you
    like pain and want to fill the disk quickly!
#
EVENT
    This command allows an immortal to cause a pre-coded event
    to happen, usually in the zone they are standing in.  These
    special events help add a bit of variety to the normal mud
    environment.
#
FORCE
    Command used to force all following arguments to be passed to
    another players' command interpreter as if they had typed it.
    Useful for helping players find things.  Commonly used for
    annoying the players.
#
GOTO
    Goes to a specified location.  Can be a mob/player or a room
    vnum.  This is your perfectly targeted teleport spell.
#
HIGHFIVE
    Another cute immortal only emote.
#
HOME
    Takes you to your home room.
#    
INVISIBLE
    A wiz invisible command.
#
LOAD
    Function to create any mob or object by name or vnum.  It will
    appear in the room with you, or in your inventory.
#
LOGS
    Toggles reception of log statements as a notify channel.  If on,
    you get debug info sent to your character.  If off, they only go
    to the logfile.
#
NOHASSLE
    Makes you invisible to all other players.  Also makes you
    impossible to attack or affect.  This can be set on mobs.
#
PLAYERS
    A more detailed who list.
#
PRETITLE
    Sets the pretitle of a character.
#
PSET
    Allows manipulation of many player attributes.  You can use this
    to restore lost gold, or tweak stats.
#
PURGE
    Destroys ALL objects and mobs in the room you are standing in!
    Useful after you've had your fun with the Berserker Axe.
#
RENTMODE
    Allows you to set the rent value multiplier.  If all the rent
    values are set properly, this should be 1.0.  You can have
    specials by using fractions, or turn rent off with 0.0 (but
    you still have to rent to not lose your items!).
#
REROLL
    Randomly rerolls the ability scores of a player or mob.
#
RESET
    Resets the zone specified.
#
RESTORE
    Restores a player (or mob) to full mana/move/health.
#
RESTOREALL
    Like restore, but to every player in the game!
#
SETREBOOT
    Sets the time of day at which the gamedriver will automatically
    reboot.  You can set two times, or set both to the same time to
    only have one reboot per day.
#
SHOW
    This is how you find what mobs match a pattern, such as
    "show guard", which produces a LOT of output.
#
SHUTDOW
    A placeholder to prevent you from accidentally shutting down
    the game.  Since this comes first in sorting, you must type
    out the entire SHUTDOWN command for it to work.
#
SHUTDOWN
    Shut the game driver down and signal the boot script to exit.
    Only do this if you are doing maintenance on the machine the
    game runs on, or if you made a horrible data-corrupting bug that
    will break things if allowed to continue.
#
SLAY
    Kills a mortal, lower level wizard, or mob.  No questions asked.
#
SNOOP
    Hooks your display onto a player so you see everything they see.
#
SNOWBALL
    A cute attack that only immortals get to use!
#
SPELLS
    Show all spells in the game.
#
STAT
    This allows you to see vital statistics on any specific item in
    the game.
#
STEALTH
    Sets the stealth flag on a player.
#
SWITCH
    Take control of a mob as if it were your character.  This is
    the bread and butter of role playing, as it lets you take the
    form of any mob, suspending the AI while you have control of
    it.
#
TICKS
    Displays when the next "tick" of various types will occur.
#
TRANSFER
    This yanks a given mob or player to your location.  Very handy
    for helping players around unintended jams, also handy when
    used with AT.
#
USERS
    A who list that shows where players are logged in from.
#
WALL
    Global emote that has no prefixes.  This can be used for
    atmosphere, or for warnings.
#
WIZHELP
    Duh!
#
WIZLOCK
    Prevent mortals from logging in.  This should be used if you
    are debugging.
#
WIZNET
    Another name for the @ command.  Wizard chat.
#
WORLD
    Some statistics about the game world.
#
ZPURGE
    Same as purge, but to an entire zone.  Handy if you want to
    reset a zone to boot-time state, do this, then do reset.
