Haven~
  Pillars of flawless white marble flow the height of this chamber laced with
a sparkling silver and golden outlines.  The ceiling, high above, combines
into a blackened dome, past which lie the stars and dreams of men.  The floor
that you trod upon seethes with etching as you can follow the lives of men
through etchings of things that were, are, and shall be.
  To the north a tremendous archway leads into a antechamber beyond from which
harmonious music flows.  Opposite, a pair of oaken doors span possibly fifty
feet high towards the impending ceiling.  To the east a hall leads from the
base of Haven.  A disturbing spiral staircase of blackest marble ascends
through the dome, high above.

thing is, you can't tell if you are on the inside or outside of a huge sphere.

of hot and cold are almost too much for you to bear.
  You can now make out a figure standing near the fire.  It seems to be

upwards, and join the myriad of stars overhead.  Sometimes the fire shifts

the body smolders, its eyes suddenly open and a soundless scream emerges
from its mouth!  The fire swiftly darkens to a murky red colour, and you see
a glowing ball of red light launch upwards to the stars.
  The pile of bodies that sits behind the fire is too large to comprehend.
It is composed of every imaginable creature, and many that you've never seen
before.  Strangely, there seems to be no ash, no remains from the fire.

his throne sits empty.

Travelers road~
  This road is well worn as many people must pass by this place to travel
the protected ways of the land.  Looking about you several buildings to
each side and some in the distance marker this place as a highway town, built
on the prospects of continual travelers passing through.
  To the west stands a building with a small sign above the door reading,
"Supplies", opposite a larger building sits hanging a sign with the words,
"Griffin's Inn" written upon it.  North and south this road seems to continue.

Griffin's Tale~
  The warm candlelight emanates a soft glow throughout this chamber revealing
the many tables and chairs that fill this large congregational.  Near the
southern wall sits a longer table that must serve as the bar, several bottles
sit upon it.  There are a few pictures near a fireplace which glow dimly,
only adding to the simple elegance of this Inn.  Just past a large picture
stands a arch which seems to lead into a back room which is deathly silent.
  A door leads to the west while to the east lies an archway opening into a

  This is a small one room farm house that has been separated into vague
rooms by small partitions.  A table lies in the center while not far away
past a partition lies what would be the bedroom with a large cot, large
enough for two to sleep upon.  A small woodburning stove keeps this area
quite warm.

Grassland~
  Tall grassland lies about you brushing up against you with its harsh stalks,
making travel through its thickness very difficult.  The sea of grass spans
out for miles everywhere you look with no apparent end to it.  Here, as
you look about you it would appear that you are standing in the middle of
some sort of ring made of mushrooms.
  Grassland lies in every direction.

 The Porch~
  This once fine mansion has fallen into disrepair.  All of the windows
have been broken and boarded up while the walls are covered with vines.
The courtyard is decayed and overgrown with weeds.  A chill wind causes one
of the shutters to bang against the side of the building.

  This large street ends abruptly in a great mountain peak that rises up high
into the sky.  Looking closely you think you can see a castle of some sort
perched high in the peak.  There is a smaller road that travels to the south
but is sided by a sparkling fence, and well taken care of.  There is a home
to the north of you built right into the mountain side.

can be seen just to the left of the flow, leading down the cliff.

Temple court~
  Small wisps of dust blow about the long courtyard in which you stand in
the center of.  A tall, poorly built wall surrounds the building to the
north of you which seems to span at least two stories high, the top of which
holds a large symbol of a open hand upon its domed roof.  Looking to the east
and west you can see that there are indeed doors which lead into the temple,
but at your current position there is only a large set of double doors
leading out from this court.

Skylight~
  You are breathless as the sun gleams through the glassteel dome of this
chamber.  As you look up, you see an image of Tyken engraved in the skylight
and you realize that you are in his shadow.  There is an aura of Peace here
and you know that you are safe here.
  A small Altar is here with the book of Tyken on top.  A comfy chair lies
near as well should you desire to peruse the book while you're here.
