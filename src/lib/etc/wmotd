Login access to the wiley account is now limited to myself alone.
I know some of you can log in via root anyways, but don't do it!

For the sake of sanity and consistancy, I'll ask that you submit
changes to the code or the world files to me and let me merge them
into the master files.  I know it's a pain, but I've given you all
complete read access to the entire game (unlike the older administration
which only handed out select tidbits of code).  If I do start getting
behind I'll let someone else share the editor's job...
