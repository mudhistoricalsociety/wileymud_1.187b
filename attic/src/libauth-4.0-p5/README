This is version 4.0 of Dans authuser library with a patch applied to
catch the SIGPIPE signal that can occur when writing to a remote
non-existant auth daemon. There is also a patch applied that fixes
the (previously) incorrect argument declaration to clearsa().

There is also a new function, auth_tcpuser4() with a additional
last argument that specifies the maximum amount of time to
wait on read():ing the reply from the remote Ident server. This
is so that things won't hang if it isn't an Ident server at the
other end... auth_tcpuser3() calls auth_tcpuser4() with a read-timeout
of 30 seconds, so if the remote site transmits the result at a slower
pace than that you will get an error back.
