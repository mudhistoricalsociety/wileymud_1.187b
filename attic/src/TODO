Quixadhal's List of Impossible Tasks:

_ Remove all unused functions from the source.
_ Remove anything that is #ifdef'd out.
_ Rewrite all "stupid" functions like MAX() and str_cmp().
_ Finish rebalancing spell code.
_ Create calling interfaces for non-implemented spells.
_ Finish druid class.
x Move fighters/ranger/thief spells into a single table with mage/clerics.
_ Redefine the costs and levels for the spells... some powerful ones are
  acquired too soon, some wimpy ones take too long to get.
_ Make all the wizard commands have a common interface style.
_ Update documentation!!!
x Change the way skills are handled.  Entires already exist in the spell
  lists, so let's use them!  Create function pointers to the skills so that
  the actual application of a skill calls the function.  This way we can
  encode levels and mana costs in here.. we just need to have a way to
  prevent people from "cast 'hide' self".
_ Finish ascii rent-object routines.
_ Rewrite ascii character routines so they don't use char_file_u.
_ Fix bugs in zone reset commands... loss of hate flags etc...
_ Create new monster class... give mobs classes and make them use them!
_ Add more randomness to zone files.... give a percentage chance for some
  mobs/objects... make sure some items always get reloaded.
_ make weather DO something!
_ change spell handling routines so they have a consistant interface... that
  is, make them all have before/after messages that can be read from a file
  like the poses.
_ make emotes a file-based system so we don't have to hardcode them into the
  stupid interpreter loop.
