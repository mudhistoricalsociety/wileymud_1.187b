Tail (Cyric) Thu Feb  4 13:55:46 1993
well, did you get it :)

Re: Tail (Harlequin) Thu Feb  4 17:11:54 1993
Hell no.  You know me, I never get anythng anymore.  Hey, I
noticed an odd thing.  I was polymorphed in the shape of a giant
tick and was killed by succubus.  I just returned to my original
body.  Is this because I'm an immort, or will that happen to
players also?  Shouldn't they die if they die in polymorphed
form?

Who/Pager (Muth) Mon Feb  8 23:04:32 1993

Cyric, could you please put a page break in the command 'who'.
So many people now it scrolls off.  8)

Charm? (Muidnar) Fri Feb 12 00:15:08 1993
You know I've only been a Wiz for a little while and it seems I'm
going drive you nuts. Well here we go.
1. What do you do about mutli char by one person.
2. Charm person works. Goodwind is running around using it. On a
   lot of people.
3. MUTH people LUV Drenth!  just though you should know :)

                                 Later

Charm (Muth) Fri Feb 12 09:31:49 1993
-= People with multiple characters must quit with one or more
   leaving only one on the game.  Players are given 3 warnings on
   this subject, each time a warning is given out post it to the
   board here so we all know what the situation is if we catch that
   same person later.  Help rules explains what the warnings mean i
   think.
-= Charm person works?  Cyrics department sorry.  cackle
-= People love drenth?  Great!  I was cackling to to myself
   working on it hoping it would cause mass suffrage, and a bit of a
   challenge.  8)

board (Muidnar) Sat Feb 13 16:49:45 1993
well there I saw a character on today 11/11/11 his name is
aladdin and is character is only 17 years old 1 month so that
would mean the char has been around for a not even a week??? Just
general info
.
Grrrrr (Muidnar) Sat Feb 13 18:12:56 1993
Well I gave Xavier,Malrot,Beldore,Voytek there first warning for
mulit char playing. I must admit it was a very nice killing group
:)
.
Re; board (Daisy) Sat Feb 13 22:21:05 1993
:)  I set up a character on Friday for taking small groups of
newer payers out on Friday [Aladdin].   Or even large groups.  :)
Didn't mean to make it  all 11th level but was too lazy to drain
it back down.  It's not going to be used for anything but this
purpose.  I seem to recall Cyric saying this was okay to do.
Correct me if I'm wrong...

Daisy

board (Muidnar) Sun Feb 14 13:18:26 1993
I didn't know that Daisy :) I just came on and saw aladdin with
11/11/11 and I had never seen him before.  So then you are the
one that plays aladdin :) Thats cool. I though it was kind of
funny that the char was only 17 and 11/11/11. (grin)
.
(Aladin (Cyric) Sun Feb 14 15:39:50 1993
The only problem I see with this is that Aladin was coming in
from s13 at UCC but me no see labelle logged in?

Immorts playing jacked characters is fine, but players playing
Immort jacked characters is not fine.

take it with a grain of salt....
.
Aladdin2 (Cyric) Sun Feb 14 15:45:10 1993
It is okay to play characters that Immorts jack up, I talked with
aladdin and asked that he not play this character anymore.  His
excuse what that he was using this character for helping newbies
out. But when I found him he was adventuring by himself going to
areas that his normal character could not have reached.

ADMIN: GAP (Quixadhal) Sat Nov 18 23:59:59 1995
There appears to be a gap in the board file records here.
Some weeks were lost.

group spells and resets (Quixadhal) Sun Nov 19 01:05:31 1995
First, I figured out the reason that most DikuMUDs reboot at
least once a day.  LpMUDs reboot to free lost memory... dikus
reboot because the reset code is broken!

I need a volunteer to look at how the zone resets happen, and
possibly rewrite part or all of it, so that it works as one
expects it to.  The game is less fun if chests filled with
magical items are empty because someone sold the item and thus it
won't create another one.
.
Meeting Results... (Quixadhal) Wed Dec 20 05:03:09 1995
Hmmmm... results?  Were there any?  We DID kill off Malistrum and
cripple Zar.  I think I outlined what we had done and what was in
the works fairly well.  Now, who is working on what?  Highlander
has his drow area in place.  A little more work to spruce it up
would be nice... and maybe a few more wandering critters.. but
good job so far!

Zar claims to be working on a paladin keep to be put in Serpent's
Reach... and Dirk claims to be working on Serpent's Reach when he
gets back from Old People's Land.

Sedna and Zar will hopefully be getting together soon with me to
has out details about Nesthar.

Highlander has also considered the idea of extending the
Underdark which would link into my own Faerie Village when I get
that done.

Muidnar... Muidnar...  What is HE doing?
Past glories are nice bub, but they don't buy the burger!  You
need to start hacking on something too.  Think about it and
suggest something.

What am I doing?  Besides my twisted evil reincarnation of the
Faerie Village from Smurfdom into a true Realm of the Fey... I've
also been and will continue to hack the code so we can add those
new classes (Paladins, Druids, Clerics of Good, Clerics of
Evil...) and new spells (silence, entangle, insect swarm,
etc...).

Cheers!  Hope to hear from some of you!

New BUGS, er... Features! (Quixadhal) Fri Dec 22 05:22:57 1995
I've been doing ALOT of hacking over break.  This is primarily to
install the low-level support that will allow us to extend
WileyMUD in major ways such as adding new classes.  I'm also
changing things to be more balanced, and adding new features as I
see opportunities in my editing.  As a result, it is more than
likely I've buggered it up in a few places.  If anyone sees
things they think are bugs, PLEASE report them to any immortal
online or using the bug command.  I'm trying to get this thing
upgraded while I have the time to code all day, but I need help
to spot the places where I got too tired at 6am. :)

Dumbass wizards (Quixadhal) Mon Feb  5 18:52:13 1996
Hey Buttknockers!

Let's not leave the game whizz locked unless something really
neat is being done eh?  Geez.... like we're being SWAMPED with
players....
.
???? (Muidnar) Thu Feb  8 17:33:16 1996

that???  by the way 5 players are on now.
May you rot in hell!

Grimwell (Muidnar) Mon Feb 12 09:47:00 1996
An old wizard Grimwell wants to build again. I was reading the
ideas and typoo logs and saw his message. Yes people do read
those! Well those of us who know where they are at. Anyway Quix
what do you think. His areas are good and need little changing
when finished. and he will build unlike the rest. Well with the
execption of the drow area that was placed in by Highlander.
Unlike wizards like Zar??? I think he is a wizard? when was the
last time he logged in????

Also why am I still 59th?

Why do I not have access to the world file?
It has only been about 6 months. I provided 3500 rooms to restore
this mud to its current condition how much longer do I have to
wait?

I also hate your typo lines. This is NOT MTV it is a mud with a
mid-evil setting, If I'm not mistaken I believe that is what we
where going to work on??? or am I wrong.

Have a Day?

                 Muidnar Hopes you rot in Hell
.
typos (Dirk) Wed Feb 14 03:45:51 1996
Oh c'mon Muidnar, lighten up. There's only one or two that say
anything like MTV ;^) The rest are pretty funny, and are much
more interesting than the standard error message
.
RE: Grimwell (Quixadhal) Wed Feb 14 18:19:18 1996
Sure.  A wizard who actually builds areas... what a unique
concept!  Is THAT what they were supposed to do?  I thought they
just logged in and harassed the players every so often like me...
ok.

Feel free  to whizzify him if he ever comes back :)
.
Grimwell (Muidnar) Thu Feb 15 17:36:43 1996
We can give him the Reach back being that was his original job,
and no one else seems to be working on it. We need guild masters
for 15-20 for rangers.

wow (Muidnar) Thu Aug  8 12:26:16 1996

mud (Muidnar) Mon Nov  4 19:04:29 1996
Tim has posted a note to send dot mud players that dot is dead.
They may move here if they can hack it.... 

Chris you need to see who is and is not a immort on the is game
and explain to them unlike dot this mud is hard and immorts if
not building or testing should not be FUCKING with the players..
or we will loose them. I also think you should make people who
want to be immorts at least make it to level 15 here so they
understand how hard it really is!!!  Yes I know that you didn't
even make it level 15 but then again you have the code and I have
the world file together they will suffer!!

                                     Chris

The Land is Dead. (Quixadhal) Tue Mar 30 16:33:42 1999
Hello fellow immortals.

I am surely speaking mostly to myself, but perhaps a few of you
have survived.  I am sorry this place has been neglected for so
long, and I fear it will never be what it once was.  But perhaps
we can carry someof it with us to a new place.

Farewell.

The Land is Empty (Quixadhal) Sun Jul 25 00:33:27 2004
The land of WileyMUD is empty, but perhaps you can bring life
back to it?  It waits only for a firm hand to force order back
into the chaos!
